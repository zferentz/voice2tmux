# // This was the initial Claude Code prompt I used to create the backend and frontend  // #

We're going to create a system that sends voice commands to a program running in tmux.

The system will have a backend and a frontend.

The Backend - listener.py
--------------------------
The backend is a simple Python web server written in FastAPI that exposes a `/listen` endpoint and waits for the client to send POST requests with text:
```
POST /listen
{ "text": "..."}
```

Once the backend gets text from the /listen endpoint, it calls the "tmux send-keys" command:
```tmux send-keys -t claude-session '$TEXT_FROM_LISTEN' Enter```

The FrontEnd - listener.html 
-----------------------------
* shows a simple chatbot window
* The user can enter text to be sent to the backend, or hit a microphone button and use voice commands to be sent to the backend
